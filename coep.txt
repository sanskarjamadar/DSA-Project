Bhau Institute of Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Leadership was set up by Mr. Narendra Kale, an alumnus of COEP (1974) and Mr. Sanjay Inamdar, a successful entrepreneur to promote incubation of enterprises from amongst COEP students.

The Idea behind Bhau Institute

"BHAU" means elder brother. An elder brother is a unique person for the young siblings in Indian culture. You enjoy a special relationship with him; He is the one you lean on for guidance, support and a helping hand in all your adventures. He allows you to fall down; helps you pick yourself up and run again. He provides just enough guidance to get you going and gradually launches you into the real world. This is the spirit for BHAU institute - It will encourage students not only to find their own calling but go after it unleashing their full potential. It will provide just enough guidance for them to support their dreams and ambitions. We desire our students to be entrepreneurs in their own right, finding their own place under the sun.
